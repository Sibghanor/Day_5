<title>MY Goals in Life</title>

<body>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hey there! I am Sibgha Noor. Currently I am persuing degree of Computer Systems Engineering from UET Peshawar.
 I am an internee at Prosensia.</p>
<h2>Primary Goal in Life</h2>
<p>
My name is Sibgha Noor, and I'm a computer systems engineering student. 
My primary goal in life is to become a successful entrepreneur by launching my own tech startup.
 The idea of independence and being my own boss, free from external pressure, has always driven me. 
 Building something from the ground up and seeing it flourish is incredibly motivating.
</p>

<p>
This goal is deeply important to me because I value  creativity,  innovation, and  control over my  destiny.  
Having a startup allows me to  channel my  ideas and  passion for technology  into creating something impactful.  
Furthermore, being my own boss allows me to  set my own pace and  priorities, fostering a work-life balance that aligns with my values.
</p>

<p>
 To make this dream a reality,
Learning all the important computer stuff in my degree program will be key to building my tech company.
 After that, I'll get a job to see how businesses work in the real world. 
This will help me learn how to run a company and solve problems. Plus, I'll join online groups and workshops about starting businesses.
Along with that I'll start working on my company idea in more detail.
 I'll also try to meet people who can help me, like experienced business people or maybe even future partners for my company.
Once I have a clear plan and maybe even a team, I'll practice explaining my idea to people 
who might invest money to help me get started.
</p>

<p>
There will definitely be some bumps on this road:

Starting a company can cost a lot of money.
 I'll need to figure out how to get the money I need, maybe by saving up, getting grants, or finding investors.
Since I'm new to running a business, there will be things I don't know yet, like how to manage money or advertise my company. 
But I'll take courses and ask for help from others to learn what I need to know.
 To make my company successful, I might need to find other skilled people to work with me. 
I'll need to find people who are good at what they do and share my vision for the company.
</p>
<p>
Success for me isn't just about making money. I want to be a strong, independent woman who makes my family proud.
 My dream is to build a cool and lasting tech company that not only solves a problem but also helps and inspires others. 
I want to use technology to make a positive difference in the world.
 This journey might be challenging, but I'm determined to learn and succeed!
